Deutsche Post is a large-scale logistics company operating around the world. DHL provides world market services both in sea and air mail.


DHL was primarily interested in offshore and inter-continental deliveries, but the success of FedEx prompted its own intra-U.S. expansion starting in 1983. DHL aggressively expanded to countries that could not be served by any other delivery service, including the Soviet Union, Eastern Bloc, Iraq, Iran, China, Vietnam, and North Korea.


Deutsche Post then effectively absorbed DHL into its Express division, while expanding the use of the DHL brand to other Deutsche Post divisions, business units and subsidiaries.


Originally founded in 1969 to deliver documents between San Francisco and Honolulu, the company expanded its service throughout the world by the late 1970s.

Just like encryption today protects data at rest and data during motion, Runtime Encryption(R) keeps keys, data, and applications completely protected even when infrastructure has been compromised and even root users are malicious. 

Fortanix's Self-Defending Key Management Service (SDKMS) is a next-generation cloud-native solution for your enterprise encryption needs. It offers key generation, management, distribution, encryption-as-a-service, HSM, KMIP, and tokenization all rolled in as a single product with the highest possible level of security and cloud scale. Available as both FIPS certified appliance and a globally available SaaS (with Equinix's strong SLA), SDKMS offers incredible simple central management, server-side load balancing, central tamper-proof logging, RESTful APIs, and Runtime Encryption(R) plugin to run custom code.

Fortanix's Runtime Encryption(R) Platform allows customers to bring any docker container and run them securely inside Intel SGX without any modification. It allows customers to share data with each other without losing control of the data, run analytics on sensitive data, run applications securely in the remote cloud, move PII-heavy sensitive data to the public cloud, etc. 

Fortanix's Enclave Development Platform (EDP) allows customers to write Rust code to run natively as SGX enclaves. Supported by the mainline Rust compiler, developers find EDP as the easiest and the most secure way of developing new applications.

In a short time, Fortanix has developed a strategic partnership with Equinix and IBM cloud and counts multiple F50 companies as its customers.
